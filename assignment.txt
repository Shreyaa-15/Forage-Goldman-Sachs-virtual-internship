What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?
-	MD5 

What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
-	MD5 is considered extremely weak for password hashing in today's security landscape. It offers a very low level of protection for passwords due to several vulnerabilities and weaknesses: Collision Vulnerabilities, Speed, Lack of Salting, and so on.

What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
-	Use Strong Password Hashing Algorithms: bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
-	Add Salt to Passwords
-	Use a High Number of Iterations
-	Implement Account Lockout Policies
-	Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?
-Weak hash functions used with no salting.
-Common passwords are used which can be easily guessed and cracked.
-No use of capital letters, numbers and special symbols together. 


What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder? 
-	Increase the minimum password length to at least 12 characters. Longer passwords are generally more secure.
-	Require a mix of character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %).
-	Prohibit the use of common dictionary words, phrases, and easily guessable patterns (e.g., "password," "123456," "qwerty," "admin").
-	Enforce a policy that prevents users from reusing their previous passwords for a certain number of iterations (e.g., 5 or more).
-	Encourage or mandate the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.
